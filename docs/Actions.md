## Actions and Workflows

This repo makes use of Github Actions. This doc details the actions and workflows that we run.

### Actions

#### bundle

The bundle action is a node script that will check the built bundle file size and report the results in a comment on the relavent PR.

#### coverage-report

The coverage-report action will read in the coverage report generated by jest, format it appropriately, and comment the results on the relavent PR.

### Workflows

#### java-pr-jobs

This workflow will simply run a `mvn package` which will run the appropriate build and tests when a pull request is made/committed to.

#### node-pr-jobs

This workflow is for all jobs related to the UI that need to be run on a pull request. This includes building, testing, linting and deploying storybook.

#### node-deploy-storybook

This workflow will automatically update the storybook hosted on Github pages when a push is made to master.
