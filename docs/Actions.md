## Actions and Workflows

This repo makes use of Github Actions. This doc details the actions and workflows that we run.

### Actions

#### bundle

The bundle action is a node script that will check the built bundle file size and report the results in a comment on the relavent PR.

#### coverage-report

The coverage-report action will read in the coverage report generated by jest, format it appropriately, and comment the results on the relavent PR.

### Workflows

#### java-build-and-test

This workflow will simply run a `mvn package` which will run the appropriate build and tests.

#### ui-build-and-test

This workflow will pull node, install the dependencies for the project, and then run `npm build` and `npm test`. These commands will produce a bundle and a coverage report which are then used by the `bundle` and `coverage-report` actions.
